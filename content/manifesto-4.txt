## A Different Kind of Economy

In the year 2025, a modest housing complex of five apartments begins a quiet experiment. Located in a mid-sized European city, it is neither utopia nor spectacle, but the slow unfolding of a different kind of economy — one where housing is no longer treated as a commodity, but as a shared resource sustained across generations.

At the outset, the municipality owns the complex and all its assets — not just in name, but in bonds. Each apartment is divided into 1,000 bonds, with their value proportional to the apartment’s size. The smallest unit, a one-room flat, has cheaper bonds than the four-room flats. This line has been added.

Every month, tenants “pay rent” — not to a landlord, but into ownership. Rent is converted into bonds: ten bonds per month, each a small but meaningful step toward full tenant control. As bonds are slowly acquired, the municipality’s stake diminishes. The goal is not profit, but transition.

This system is not about owning property, but about building shared responsibility and collective care.  They are both a record of contribution and a mechanism for return.

> When someone moves out, they retain their bonds, but they no longer accumulate new ones. Instead, their existing bonds begin to transfer to the new tenant, who purchases them gradually with each month’s rent.

As the outgoing tenant’s ownership decreases, their invested value is returned in real time. It’s a form of reverse amortization — slow exit rather than profit extraction. Another addition here.

If a tenant dies, their bonds do not pass to an heir. Instead, they are redistributed equally among the current tenants of the building. The system resists the logic of intergenerational wealth-hoarding and reframes housing as a right, not an asset.

### Life Over Seven Generations

The life of this building unfolds over seven generations, each a decade long. In 2025, the flats are occupied by diverse households:  
- A young couple in the one-room unit  
- Two friends cohabiting in the two-room flat  
- A small nuclear family in the three-room  
- An intergenerational household in the larger four-room unit  
- A solitary older person in the remaining four-room flat

Time passes.

- In the second generation, the young couple splits. One stays and continues to acquire bonds while the other is slowly bought out by the next tenant.
- In the third generation, children grow up and move into their own units. A group of students replaces the elderly tenant; their bonds are redistributed.
- In the fourth generation, one resident cannot pay rent — the collective agreement pauses their bond accumulation without eviction.
- Maintenance costs are shared and paid through the coop’s collective fund.

Over time, the character of the building changes. Friendships form and fade. Tenants age, die, or relocate. The economic mechanism adapts not through algorithms or contracts, but through conversation.

Every ten years, a new version of the building’s manifesto is written — a living rental agreement that responds to real, lived tensions:  
- How to account for care work within households?  
- Should bond distribution reflect emotional labour?  
- What happens when someone needs to leave abruptly?

### Shared Decision-Making

In multi-person households, bonds are split according to a declaration made at the start of their cohabitation. They may choose equal division, or reflect financial contributions. If one partner pays rent and another cooks and cleans, their bond agreement can reflect that.

These decisions are local and negotiated — not bureaucratically imposed, but communally made and revisable.

### The Future

By 2085, the seventh generation lives in a building that no one owns outright — but that everyone inhabits with care. The municipality has long since been fully bought out. The bonds now circulate entirely within the tenant community, and the reinvestment of monthly rent supports maintenance, communal infrastructure, and new cooperative housing projects elsewhere in the city.

This model was developed in direct response to the ongoing housing crisis and the deepening inequalities it produces. Inherited wealth has become one of the primary factors determining access to stable housing — a dynamic that entrenches privilege across generations while excluding others.

By removing the profit motive and inheritance logic from the housing system, this model offers a concrete alternative: one where housing is understood not as an individual investment, but as a shared, intergenerational commitment.

> Its circular economy offers continuity without accumulation; security without speculation.

This is a model to be scaled — not through corporate franchising, but through grassroots replication and municipal partnerships. It is not just a critique of the current system, but a living proposal for something more equitable.
