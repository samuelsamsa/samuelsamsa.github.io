Cohousing Agreement for the UNIDA Collective Housing Complex Preamble

This agreement continues the evolving articulation of the UNIDA Collective Housing Complex, building upon the foundation laid in 2025. It reflects a deepening of the tenants’ shared commitment to collective care, mutual responsibility, and sustainable living. What began as a founding vision has become a living framework—shaped by lived experiences, renegotiated responsibilities, and a growing understanding of what it means to inhabit collectively. This system remains untethered from ownership as a commodity, emphasizing instead a cooperative ethos that balances individual needs with collective well-being and resilience.

Article 1: Purpose and Intent 
1.1 The aim of this housing model is to create a community where housing is no longer seen as something to be owned, but as something we all share and value together. This complex is a place where all residents contribute to, benefit from, and help sustain their living environment for present and future generations. 
1.2 The system challenges the profit-driven nature of real estate and the inheritance of wealth, focusing instead on long-term stability and care across generations. Housing is seen as a basic right, not something to be treated as a privilege or a financial asset.

Article 2: Structure of Ownership and Bonds 
2.1 Municipal Ownership: At the outset, the municipality is the owner of the housing complex and all its assets, including the land and physical infrastructure. 
2.2 Bonds: 
• Each apartment is divided into 1,000 bonds. The value of each bond is proportional to the size of the apartment. The smallest unit (1 room flat) will have cheaper bonds, while the larger units (up to 4 room flats) will have more expensive bonds. 
• Tenants are required to pay "the bond" each month every month. 
• As tenants accumulate bonds, the municipality’s stake in the building diminishes proportionally. The goal is to transition ownership to the tenants over generations.

Article 3: Rules of Bond Ownership 
3.1 Non-Speculative Bonds: 
• Bonds cannot be resold or inherited. They are a record of the tenant’s contribution to the collective ownership of the building. 
• Bonds cannot be transferred to a third party outside the tenant community, nor can they be sold for profit. 
• If a tenant moves out, they retain the bonds they have accumulated, but they no longer accrue new bonds. The outgoing tenant’s bonds are gradually transferred to the new tenant. 
3.2 Exit Process: 
• The tenant’s accumulated bonds are “bought out” in real time by the new tenant as part of their monthly rent payments. This is a form of reverse amortization, ensuring that the outgoing tenant's financial contributions are returned over time. 
• If a tenant passes away, their bonds are not inherited by heirs. Instead, they are shared equally among the remaining tenants, ensuring a collective approach to maintaining balance within the community.

Article 4: Distribution of Bonds in Multi-Person Households 
4.1 For households with multiple people, bond distribution is determined at the start of their cohabitation. 
4.2 Households can choose one of two methods for bond allocation: 
• Equal division of bonds between all household members. 
• Proportional division, reflecting the financial contributions or labor contributions of each member. 
• Any changes to the division of bonds within the household can be renegotiated at any time with the mutual consent of all involved parties.
4.3 Household Splits: If a household splits, the bonds that were accumulated by the departing person will be paid back to them progressively. The person staying in the household will gradually begin to accumulate those bonds. The amount of bonds transferred back to the person leaving will be based on the time they were a member of the household and the bonds they accrued during that time.
4.4 Joining a Household: If a new person joins an existing household, they will begin to accumulate bonds progressively, starting from the moment they become part of the household. These bonds will be added to their personal allocation each month as they pay rent and contribute to the household, until they have accumulated an amount proportional to their residence and time within the community.

Article 5: Choosing a New Member to Join a Household
5.1 Selection Process: When a household wishes to add a new member, the decision to admit that person is made based on a combination of the number of bonds already owned by the existing members of the household and the collective agreement of the household members.
5.2 Bond-Based Voting Power: The decision to approve or deny a new member’s entry into the household is determined by the proportion of bonds owned by each member of the household. Tenants with more bonds have a greater say in the decision-making process. However, all members of the household must reach a consensus on the decision.
5.3 Application Process: The person wishing to join a household must submit an application through a formal process, which will include a description of their reasons for joining and how they plan to contribute to the household. This application will be reviewed by the current household members, and a decision will be made through consensus.
5.4 Apartment Size Consideration: The apartment size allocated to a new household will be based on the number of people in the household and their needs. A household of four people, for example, will have more chances of being allocated a four-room apartment than a single-person household. The distribution of apartments is designed to support household growth and ensure fairness in the allocation process based on the number of individuals needing housing.

Article 6: Adaptability and Revision of the Collective Agreement
6.1 This agreement will evolve through periodic revisions, ensuring that it remains responsive to the lived realities and changing circumstances of the tenants.
6.2 If necessary, a new version of the collective agreement will be created through open dialogue and consensus, responding to collective needs.

Article 7: The Role of the Municipality
7.1 The municipality will remain a partner in this initiative but will gradually divest its stake over time.
7.2 The municipality’s role is not to profit from this model but to facilitate and support the transition of ownership to the tenant community.
7.3 Upon complete divestment, the cooperative will function entirely without municipal ownership, with all decision-making power residing within the tenant community.

Article 8: Longevity of the Cohousing Model
8.1 The system is designed to evolve across generations, ensuring long-term sustainability for tenants and the building itself.
8.2 With time, the bonds will circulate entirely within the tenant community. Rent payments will fund the maintenance and upkeep of the building as well as support new cooperative housing initiatives elsewhere in the city.
8.3 The aim is to provide housing security, continuity, and intergenerational care while resisting the pressures of speculation, ownership, and wealth accumulation.

Article 9: Death, Relocation, and Redistribution of Bonds
9.1 In the event of a tenant’s death, their bonds will not pass to their heirs. Instead, the bonds will be redistributed equally among the remaining tenants.
9.2 If a tenant relocates or chooses to leave the building, their bonds will begin to transfer to the incoming tenant gradually over time, following the exit process described in Article 3.
9.3 The redistribution of bonds upon death or departure will ensure the continued fluidity of ownership within the tenant community without creating financial windfalls for individuals or families.

Article 10: Community Governance and Decision-Making
10.1 Consensus-Based Governance: Decisions related to the collective management of the building, including changes to this agreement, will be made through a consensus process.
10.2 Regular Community Meetings: Tenants will meet regularly to discuss issues of maintenance, governance, and any other concerns affecting the community.
10.3 Conflict Resolution: In the case of disputes or disagreements, a collective process of mediation and conflict resolution will be undertaken to ensure that all voices are heard and considered in finding a fair solution.

Signatories:
By signing this agreement, each tenant acknowledges their commitment to these principles and their responsibility to uphold the shared values of this cooperative housing model.
