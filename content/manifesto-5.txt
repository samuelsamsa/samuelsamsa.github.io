Cohousing Agreement for the UNI2 Collective Housing Network Preamble

This agreement marks a continuation of the UNI2 Collective Housing Complex network’s journey, building on the foundation set in 2025. It strengthens the tenants’ shared commitment to stable housing, collective care, and mutual responsibility across all the buildings in the network. What started as a vision has evolved into a living system—shaped by experience, renegotiated roles, and a deeper understanding of what it means to live together. This approach remains detached from the idea of housing as a commodity, focusing instead on a cooperative model that prioritizes stable, secure living while balancing individual needs with the well-being and resilience of the entire network of communities.

Article 1: Purpose and Intent 
1.1 The aim of this housing model is to create a community where housing is no longer seen as something to be owned, but as something we all share and value together. This complex is a place where all residents contribute to, benefit from, and help sustain their living environment for present and future generations. 
1.2 The system challenges the profit-driven nature of real estate and the inheritance of wealth, focusing instead on long-term stability and care across generations. Housing is seen as a basic right, not something to be treated as a privilege or a financial asset.

Article 2: Structure of Ownership and Bonds 
2.1 Municipal Ownership: At the outset, the municipality is the owner of the housing complex and all its assets, including the land and physical infrastructure. 
2.2 Bonds: 
• Each apartment is divided into 1,000 bonds. The value of each bond is proportional to the size of the apartment. The smallest unit (1 room flat) will have cheaper bonds, while the larger units (up to 4 room flats) will have more expensive bonds. 
• Tenants are required to pay "the bond" each month every month. Once the flat is fully paid off, tenants are no longer required to make any further payments, except for maintenance costs.
• As tenants accumulate bonds, the municipality’s stake in the building diminishes proportionally. The goal is to transition ownership to the tenants over generations.

Article 3: Rules of Bond Ownership 
3.1 Non-Speculative Bonds: 
• Bonds cannot be resold or inherited. They are a record of the tenant’s contribution to the collective ownership of the building. 
• Bonds cannot be transferred to a third party outside the tenant community, nor can they be sold for profit, ensuring that the system remains fair and focused on collective well-being. 
• If a tenant moves out, they temporally retain the bonds they have accumulated, but they no longer accrue new bonds. The outgoing tenant’s bonds are gradually transferred to the new tenant, even if they do not want them to be transferred.
3.2 Exit Process: 
• The tenant’s accumulated bonds are “bought out” in real time by the new tenant as part of their monthly rent payments. This is a form of reverse amortization, ensuring that the outgoing tenant's financial contributions are returned over time. 
• If a tenant passes away, their bonds are not inherited by heirs. Instead, they are shared equally among the remaining tenants, ensuring a collective approach to maintaining balance within the community.

Article 4: Distribution of Bonds in Multi-Person Households 
4.1 For households with multiple people, bond distribution is determined at the start of their cohabitation. 
4.2 Households can choose one of two methods for bond allocation: 
• Equal division of bonds between all household members. 
• Proportional division, reflecting the financial contributions or labor contributions of each member. 
• Any changes to the division of bonds within the household can be renegotiated at any time with the mutual consent of all involved parties.
4.3 Household Splits: If a household splits, the bonds that were accumulated by the departing person will be paid back to them progressively. The person staying in the household will gradually begin to accumulate those bonds. The amount of bonds transferred back to the person leaving will be based on the time they were a member of the household and the bonds they accrued during that time.
4.4 Joining a Household: If a new person joins an existing household, they will begin to accumulate bonds progressively, starting from the moment they become part of the household. These bonds will be added to their personal allocation each month as they pay rent and contribute to the household, until they have accumulated an amount proportional to their residence and time within the community.

Article 5: Choosing a New Member to Join a Household
5.1 Selection Process: When a household wishes to add a new member, the decision to admit that person is made based on a combination of the number of bonds already owned by the existing members of the household and the collective agreement of the household members.
5.2 Bond-Based Voting Power: The decision to approve or deny a new member’s entry into the household is determined by the proportion of bonds owned by each member of the household. Tenants with more bonds have a greater say in the decision-making process. However, all members of the household must reach a consensus on the decision.
5.3 Application Process: The person wishing to join a household must submit an application through a formal process, which will include a description of their reasons for joining and how they plan to contribute to the household. This application will be reviewed by the current household members, and a decision will be made through consensus.
5.4 Apartment Size Consideration: The apartment size allocated to a new household will be based on the number of people in the household and their needs. A household of four people, for example, will have more chances of being allocated a four-room apartment than a single-person household. The distribution of apartments is designed to support household growth and ensure fairness in the allocation process based on the number of individuals needing housing.

Article 6: Prohibition of Subletting and External Property Ownership6.1 Subletting Prohibited: Subletting the apartment is strictly prohibited. If atenant is found subletting the apartment, the household will be expelled from thebuilding, and they will be required to vacate immediately.6.2 No Wealth Accumulation Through External Property: The purpose of thissystem is to stop treating housing as wealth. If any member of the householdacquires or buys a property outside of this system, they will no longer be allowedto stay in the cohousing complex. This rule aims to ensure that housing remains ashared, communal resource rather than an asset for individual wealthaccumulation.
Article 7: Children Gaining Bonds Upon Turning 187.1 Gaining Bonds: Once children residing in the household turn 18 years old,they will begin to accumulate bonds at the same rate as the other tenants. Thesebonds will be added progressively to their personal allocation as they contributeto the household and pay rent.

Article 8: Affordability and Reintegrating Into the System8.1 Inability to Afford Payments: If a household is unable to afford paying rent andaccumulating bonds, they will stop gaining bonds. Their total amount of bonds will neitherincrease nor decrease during this period.8.2 Reintegrating Through Maintenance: There is an option to reintegrate into the system byoffering the household an opportunity to take on responsibility for the maintenance of thecommon areas of the building. This provides a way for those who cannot currently afford rentto continue contributing to the community and maintain a stable housing situation.8.3 Stable Housing: The system’s primary goal is to create a stable housing situation foreveryone, without the stress of financial insecurity, and ensure that housing remains accessibleregardless of economic challenges.
Article 9: Municipality’s Full Payment of Apartments9.1 Municipality Fully Paid Apartments: Some of the apartments in the building are now fullypaid to the municipality. These apartments no longer involve the municipality's financial stake,and their role in the system has ended.9.2 Absence of Municipality in Ownership: As the municipality has fully divested from certainapartments, its presence and financial stake no longer impact the day-to-day governance andoperation of the housing system.
Article 10: Governance and Leadership10.1 Governance Structure: The organization is fully internal and horizontal, extending across all buildings in the network. Each building follows a shared governance model, with leadership that rotates every six months. The head’s role is primarily coordinating and administrative, ensuring communication between tenants within each building and across the network, but does not hold decision-making power on collective matters affecting the entire community.
10.2 Role of the Head: The head is responsible for overseeing operational tasks within their building and facilitating communication both within the building and with other buildings in the network. This ensures continuity in leadership across the network while maintaining a fair, rotating responsibility among all residents. The system fosters collaboration and shared decision-making, strengthening the connection between buildings and reinforcing the cooperative nature of the network.

Article 11: Expansion into a Network of Buildings11.1 Network of Buildings: This cohousing system is not limited to a single building but hasexpanded into a network that spans multiple buildings. Each building follows the same coreprinciples, with specific adaptations based on local needs and conditions.11.2 Gatherings Between Buildings: To promote community and shared learning, gatheringsbetween different cohousing buildings are encouraged. These gatherings foster discussions onthe system, its evolution, and how to improve the collective living experience.11.3 Relocation Between Buildings: If a household wishes to move from one building toanother, their bonds remain connected to their previous building. They will start receiving thevalue of their prior bonds while also beginning to accumulate new bonds based on the rentthey pay in the new apartment.11.4 Eligibility for Moving Between Buildings: The eligibility rules for moving betweenbuildings remain consistent across the network. However, the reasons for relocating must bejustifiable. Priorities for relocation will be given to those needing to move for work, personal life necessities, or similar reasons. Personal choices or leisure will not be considered sufficientgrounds for relocation.

Article 12: Adaptability and Revision of the Collective Agreement
12.1 This agreement will evolve through periodic revisions to ensure that it consistently meets the changing needs and realities of the tenants, fostering a secure housing environment for all.
12.2 If needed, a new version of the collective agreement will be created through open dialogue and consensus, ensuring that the security and stability of housing are always prioritized to meet the collective needs.

Article 13: The Role of the Municipality
13.1 The municipality will remain a partner in this initiative but will gradually divest its stake over time.
13.2 The municipality’s role is not to profit from this model but to facilitate and support the transition of ownership to the tenant community.
13.3 Upon complete divestment, the cooperative will function entirely without municipal ownership, with all decision-making power residing within the tenant community.

Article 14: Longevity of the Cohousing Model
14.1 The system is designed to evolve across generations, ensuring long-term sustainability for tenants and the building itself.
14.2 With time, the bonds will circulate entirely within the tenant community. Rent payments will fund the maintenance and upkeep of the building as well as support new cooperative housing initiatives elsewhere in the city.
14.3 The aim is to provide housing security, continuity, and intergenerational care while resisting the pressures of speculation, ownership, and wealth accumulation.

Article 15: Collective Maintenance and Cooperative Fund15.1 Maintenance Fund: The cooperative will collectively fund the ongoing maintenance of thebuilding, which includes infrastructure repairs, communal spaces, and any necessary upgrades to the property.15.2 Contributions:• All tenants contribute to the maintenance fund through their monthly rent payments.• Special assessments may be levied if the need for major repairs arises, though suchassessments will be decided collectively by the tenants through consensus.15.3 Collective Agreement on Care Work: The collective agreement, which is revised everydecade, will take into account the contribution of care work within households, andadjustments may be made to reflect these contributions in the bond distribution ormaintenance fund allocation.

Article 16: Death, Relocation, and Redistribution of Bonds
16.1 In the event of a tenant’s death, their bonds will not pass to their heirs. Instead, the bonds will be redistributed equally among the remaining tenants.
16.2 If a tenant relocates or chooses to leave the building, their bonds will begin to transfer to the incoming tenant gradually over time, following the exit process described in Article 3.
16.3 The redistribution of bonds upon death or departure will ensure the continued fluidity of ownership within the tenant community without creating financial windfalls for individuals or families.

Article 17: Community Governance and Decision-Making
17.1 Consensus-Based Governance: Decisions related to the collective management of the buildings, including changes to this agreement, will be made through a consensus process. This process will be coordinated not only within each building but also across the entire network, ensuring that all buildings are aligned and that the voice of each community is heard in collective decision-making.
17.2 Regular Community Meetings: Tenants will meet regularly, both within individual buildings and across the network, to discuss issues of maintenance, governance, and any other concerns affecting the broader community. These meetings foster collaboration, shared learning, and transparency across all buildings in the network.
17.3 Conflict Resolution: In the case of disputes or disagreements, a collective process of mediation and conflict resolution will be undertaken, involving tenants from relevant buildings as necessary. This ensures that all voices are heard and considered in finding a fair solution, reinforcing solidarity and cooperation between the buildings in the network.
